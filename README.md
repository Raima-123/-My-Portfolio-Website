A portfolio website is a curated online space where you showcase your skills, experience, and achievements. It serves as a digital platform to demonstrate your expertise to potential clients, employers, or collaborators. Think of it as an interactive resume or a visual storytelling tool that allows you to highlight your work in a more engaging way.
